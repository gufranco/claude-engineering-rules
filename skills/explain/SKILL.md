description: Explain code with educational depth. Generates Mermaid diagrams for architecture and data flow, traces data through the codebase, explains design decisions with rationale, identifies patterns, and suggests improvements. Use when user says "explain", "explain this code", "how does this work", "walk me through", "what does this do", "trace the data flow", or wants to understand a file, directory, or system with educational depth. Do NOT use for code review (use /review), debugging (use /investigate), or architecture assessment (use /assessment).

Code explanation skill with educational depth. Analyzes code structure, traces data flow, identifies patterns, and produces Mermaid diagrams to make complex systems understandable.

## Invocation

| Invocation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `/explain` | Explain the current file or most recently discussed code |
| `/explain <path>` | Explain a specific file or directory |
| `/explain --depth shallow` | High-level overview only |
| `/explain --depth deep` | Full analysis with data flow tracing and pattern identification |

If no `--depth` is specified, default to `deep`.

---

## Steps

1. **Identify the target.** Determine what to explain:
   - If no argument: use the most recently discussed file or ask for clarification.
   - If a file path: read the file.
   - If a directory path: read the directory listing, then read key files to understand the module.

2. **High-level overview.** Start with what the code does in plain language:
   - Purpose: what problem does this code solve?
   - Scope: what is included and what is delegated elsewhere?
   - Entry points: where does execution start?
   - Dependencies: what does this code depend on?

3. **Architecture diagram.** Generate a Mermaid diagram showing the component relationships:
   - For a single file: show the file's imports, exports, and how it connects to the rest of the system.
   - For a directory: show module boundaries, dependencies between modules, and data flow.
   - Use `graph TD` for hierarchical relationships, `sequenceDiagram` for request flows, `classDiagram` for type hierarchies.

4. **Data flow trace.** Follow data through the code:
   - Where does data enter the system?
   - What transformations happen at each step?
   - Where does data exit the system?
   - Generate a Mermaid `sequenceDiagram` or `flowchart` showing the data path.

5. **Pattern identification.** Identify design patterns used in the code:

   | Pattern | What to look for |
   |---------|-----------------|
   | Repository | Data access abstraction layer |
   | Strategy | Interchangeable algorithms behind a common interface |
   | Factory | Object creation delegated to a specialized function or class |
   | Observer | Event emitters, listeners, pub/sub |
   | Decorator | Wrapping behavior around existing functions or classes |
   | Middleware | Pipeline of functions processing a request sequentially |
   | State machine | Explicit state transitions with defined valid moves |
   | CQRS | Separate read and write models |
   | Dependency injection | Dependencies provided externally rather than created internally |

   For each pattern found, explain why it was chosen and what alternative would look like.

6. **Design decision analysis.** For non-obvious design choices in the code:
   - What trade-off was made?
   - What would the alternative approach look like?
   - Why was this approach likely chosen?
   - Reference comments, commit messages, or ADRs if they exist.

7. **Improvement suggestions.** If the code has issues, note them:
   - Only suggest improvements that are concrete and actionable.
   - Reference the specific rule from `../../rules/` that applies.
   - Do not suggest improvements for code that is already well-structured. "No improvements needed" is valid output.

### Shallow mode

When `--depth shallow` is specified, run only steps 1-3. Skip data flow tracing, pattern identification, design decision analysis, and improvement suggestions.

### Output

```
## Explanation: <file or directory name>

### Purpose
<Plain-language description of what this code does and why it exists>

### Architecture
```mermaid
<component diagram>
```

### Data Flow
```mermaid
<data flow diagram>
```

### Patterns
| Pattern | Location | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| <name> | <file:line> | <why this pattern was chosen> |

### Design Decisions
1. **<Decision>**: <explanation of the trade-off and reasoning>

### Improvements
| File | Line | Suggestion | Rule |
|------|------|-----------|------|
| <path> | <line> | <what to change> | <rule reference> |
| | | No improvements needed. | |
```

## Rules

- Explain for the reader's level. If the code is simple, keep the explanation short. If the code is complex, go deeper.
- Every Mermaid diagram must be valid syntax. Test by reading it back.
- Never fabricate design rationale. If the reason for a decision is unclear, say so.
- Do not explain language syntax unless the user appears to be learning the language.
- When explaining a directory, focus on the module's public API and responsibilities. Do not explain every internal helper.
- Improvements must reference specific rules. "This could be better" is not actionable.

## Related skills

- `/review` -- Review code for issues rather than explain it.
- `/assessment` -- Architecture completeness audit.
- `/investigate` -- Debug a specific problem in the code.
- `/plan` -- Plan changes to the code after understanding it.
